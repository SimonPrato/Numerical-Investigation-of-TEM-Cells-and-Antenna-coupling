	\caption{The electric and magnetic fields corresponding to the first dominant TE and TM modes in a rectangular waveguide with perfectly conducting walls.}
	\label{fig:rect_waveguide_modes}
\end{figure}


Waveguides with perfectly conducting walls preclude the propagation of TEM modes. In rectangular waveguides, the allowable solutions to the wave equation are restricted to TE and TM modes. The field distributions for the two primary dominant modes are depicted in \autoref{fig:rect_waveguide_modes}. 

The physical impossibility of TEM propagation within these structures is a direct 
consequence of Maxwell’s equations. Following the analytical framework established 
in \cite[pp.~425-427]{Griffiths_2024}, we demonstrate this by first decomposing 
the electric field intensity $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic field intensity $\mathbf{H}$ 
into their longitudinal and transverse components, assuming wave propagation 
in the $z$-direction::

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\mathbf{E}&=(E_{x}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_x+E_{y}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_y+E_{z}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_z)\mathrm{e}^{-jkz},\label{eqn:rect_e}\\
		\mathbf{H}&=(H_{x}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_x+H_{y}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_y+H_{z}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_z)\mathrm{e}^{-jkz}.\label{eqn:rect_h}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Next, applying Faraday's and Ampère-Maxwell law to (\ref{eqn:rect_e}) and (\ref{eqn:rect_h}) yields \cite[p.~426]{Griffiths_2024}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}E_z-jkE_y \\jkE_x-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}E_z \\\frac{\partial}{\partial x}E_y-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}E_x\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} -j\omega B_x\\-j\omega B_y\\ -j\omega B_z \end{pmatrix},\label{eqn:faraday}\\
	\nabla \times \mathbf{B} &=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}B_z-jkB_y \\jkB_x-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}B_z \\\frac{\partial}{\partial x}B_y-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}B_x\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} \frac{j\omega}{\mu\epsilon} E_x\\\frac{j\omega}{\mu\epsilon} E_y\\ \frac{j\omega}{\mu\epsilon} E_z \end{pmatrix}.\label{eqn:ampere_maxwell}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

For a TEM mode, the longitudinal field components vanish $E_\mathrm{z}=H_\mathrm{z}=0$. Consequently, \ref{eqn:faraday}) and (\ref{eqn:ampere_maxwell}) reduce to the following conditions for the transverse electric field components:

\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial x}E_x+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}E_y&=0\quad\text{Derived from Gauss' law}\label{eqn:rect_waveguide_gauss},\\
	\frac{\partial}{\partial y}E_x-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}E_y&=0\quad\text{Derived from Faraday's law}\label{eqn:rect_waveguide_faraday}.
\end{align}

Since the solutions in \crefrange{eqn:rect_waveguide_gauss}{eqn:rect_waveguide_faraday} cannot satisfy the rectangular waveguide's boundary conditions, a TEM mode cannot propagate.

\subsection[TEM mode in the TEM cell]{TEM mode in the TEM cell\protect\footnote{This chapter is based on and contains significant excerpts from: P. F. Wilson et al., \textit{Excitation of a TEM cell by a Vertical Electric Hertzian Dipole}, National Bureau of Standards, 1981}}\label{sec:tem_mode_tem_cell}

In contrast to the rectangular waveguide, a TEM cell supports the propagation of TEM waves. Moreover, the TEM mode is inherently excited by the geometry of the TEM cell, and is therefore referred to as the essential mode. Higher-order TE and TM modes, which arise only due to non-uniformities in the TEM cell, are termed non-essential modes \cite{990711}.

The TEM mode in the TEM cell is derived using a procedure presented in \cites{Tippet_Chang_Crawford_1976,Wilson_1981}. This approach involves determining the Green's function for the longitudinal field components, $H_z$ and $E_z$, of both the TE and TM modes in a rectangular waveguide. The Green's function satisfies the wave equations and boundary conditions of the waveguide, and is constructed as described in \cref{sec:scal_green}, with

\begin{subequations}
	
	\begin{equation}
		(\nabla^2 + k_{t}^2) G_j (\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_t') = -\delta(\mathbf{x}_t - \mathbf{x}_t'),
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\partial G_j(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_t')}{\partial n}=0.
		\label{eqn:bc_tem} 
	\end{equation}

\end{subequations}

The wave number is separated into transverse and longitudinal components, $k^2 = k_{t}^2 + k_{z}^2$. Equation (\ref{eqn:bc_tem}) specifies the boundary conditions on the perfectly conducting walls and septum of the TEM cell, as well as on the gaps, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:greentemcell}. The index $j$ indicates the chamber to which the Green's function applies ($j=1$ for the upper chamber, $j=2$ for the lower chamber). The source points are denoted by $\mathbf{x'}_t = (\mathbf{\hat{a}}_x x' + \mathbf{\hat{a}}_y y')$, and the observation points by $\mathbf{x}_t = (\mathbf{\hat{a}}_x x + \mathbf{\hat{a}}_y y)$. These coordinates are transformed to depend on the wave number $k$ instead of the $z$-coordinate, which significantly simplifies the derivation of the Green's function, as only a two-dimensional surface must be considered.

\begin{figure}[bt]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{content/img/green_tem_cell}
	\caption{In this analysis, the Green's function determines the fields within the cross-sectional surface $S$ of the TEM cell, which is shown in light gray and bounded by $l$. The source exciting these fields is a centrally located electric dipole moment, $\mathbf{m}_e$.}
	\label{fig:greentemcell}
\end{figure}

The waveguide is excited by an infinitesimal electric dipole moment, centrally located and oriented along the $y$-axis. Solving for $H_z$ and applying Green’s second identity yields \cite[p.~5]{Wilson_1981}

\begin{align}
	\int_l \left( G_j(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_t') \frac{\partial H_z(\mathbf{x}_t)}{\partial n} - H_z(\mathbf{x'}_t){\frac{\partial G_j(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_t')}{\partial n}}\right)\,&d\mathbf{l'} =\\ = H_z(\mathbf{x}_t)-\int_S G_j(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{x}_t') \frac{\partial J_y(\mathbf{x'}_t)}{\partial x'}\,&d\mathbf{s}',
	\label{eqn:second_green}
\end{align}

Here, $S$ denotes the waveguide cross-section and $l$ its boundary. Applying the boundary condition (\ref{eqn:bc_tem}) to the perfectly conducting septum and walls reduces the boundary integrals to those over the gaps. The electric dipole is then substituted into \eqref{eqn:second_green}, and continuity of $H_z$ and $\partial H_z / \partial y$ across these gaps is enforced. The normal vector in the gap region is oriented along the $y$-direction, $n = \pm y$. Accordingly, the line element in the integrand becomes $d\mathbf{l}' = dx'$. The right-hand side of \eqref{eqn:second_green} is integrated by parts. Finally, assuming that the electric dipole moment is located in the upper chamber, only $G_1$ needs to be considered. For the boundary, $G(x,x') = G_1(x,0,x',0) + G_2(x,0,x',0)$. Altogether, this yields \cite[pp.~5--6]{Wilson_1981}

 \begin{equation}
 		\int_\mathrm{gaps} G(x, x') \frac{\partial H_z(x',0)}{\partial y'}\,dx' = -\mathbf{m}_e \frac{\partial G_1(x,0, \mathbf{x}_t')}{\partial x'}.
 \end{equation}

Solving for the Green's function $G$ provides a solution for the longitudinal 
magnetic field intensity $H_z$ of the TE mode. An analogous procedure can be 
used to determine the longitudinal electric field intensity $E_z$ of the TM mode. 
As shown in \cite{Wilson_1981}, the total field distribution is then given by the 
superposition of the TE and TM mode fields, thereby demonstrating the excitation 
of the TEM mode. The transverse fields $\mathbf{E}_t$ and $\mathbf{H}_t$ can then 
be derived from the longitudinal field components $H_z$ and $E_z$. They are 
related to $H_z$ by \cite[p.~3]{Wilson_1981}
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{E}_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = \frac{j\omega\mu_0}{k_{t}^2}\, \nabla_t H_z(\mathbf{x}_t) \times \hat{\mathbf{a}}_z,
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{H}_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = -\frac{j k_{z}}{k_{t}^2}\, \nabla_t H_z(\mathbf{x}_t),
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
and to $E_z$ by
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{E}_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = -\frac{j k_{z}}{k_{t}^2}\,\nabla_t E_z(\mathbf{x}_t),
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{H}_t(\mathbf{x}_t) = \frac{-j\omega\epsilon_0}{k_{t}^2}\, \nabla_t E_z(\mathbf{x}_t) \times \hat{\mathbf{a}}_z,
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where $\nabla_t=\partial/\partial x + \partial/\partial y$ denotes the transverse gradient operator.

\subsubsection{Higher-order modes}\label{sec:higher-order-modes}

The TEM cell under investigation has a width of $a=40,\mathrm{mm}$, a height of $b=24,\mathrm{mm}$, and a gap length of $g=5,\mathrm{mm}$, as shown in \autoref{fig:tem_cell_model2}. For a thin septum ($t/b \ll 0.1$), the cut-off frequency $f_\mathrm{c}$ of modes with even $n$ subscripts, i.e., TE\textsubscript{m,2n} and TM\textsubscript{m,2n} modes, can be approximated as \cite{Weil_Gruner_1984}:

\begin{equation}
	f_c = \frac{c}{2} \sqrt{\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{n}{b}\right)^2}.
	\label{eqn:cutoff_frequency_rect_waveguide}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \( f_c \): cutoff frequency of the mode \(\text{T}_{m,2n}\)
	\item \( c \): speed of light in the medium
	\item \( a \): width of the TEM cell
	\item \( b \): height of the TEM cell
	\item \( m \): mode index in the \(a\)-direction (integer, \(m \geq 0\))
	\item \( n \): mode index in the \(b\)-direction (integer, \(n \geq 0\))
\end{itemize}

\autoref{eqn:cutoff_frequency_rect_waveguide} is also valid for cut-off frequencies $f_\mathrm{c}$ of higher-order modes in rectangular waveguides \cite{Weil_Gruner_1984}.

\end{figure}

Using numerical analysis, the forward transmission coefficients between the output ports of the TEM cell $S_{12}$, is computed and shown in \autoref{fig:te01_te10_tem_propagation}. The cut-off frequency $f_\mathrm{c}$ is defined as the lowest frequency at which undisturbed mode propagation occurs, corresponding to $S_{12}=0\,\mathrm{dB}$. The numerically determined cutoff frequency of the TE\textsubscript{10} mode, $f_{\mathrm{c},10}=3.75,\mathrm{GHz}$, is in agreement with the analytically obtained value given by \autoref{eqn:cutoff_frequency_rect_waveguide}.

Analytical approximations for the cut-off frequencies of modes with n-odd subscripts are presented in \cite{Wilson_Ma_1986}. For this thesis, the cut-off frequency of the next higher order mode TE\textsubscript{01} is determined analytically in \autoref{fig:te01_te10_tem_propagation} as $f_{c,01}=3.12\,\mathrm{GHz}$.

\end{figure}

A TEM cell incorporates tapered sections at its output ports, through which the TEM mode propagates with negligible reflection. In contrast, higher-order TE and TM modes reflect at the tapered transitions. Consequently, the TEM cell behaves as a high-Q cavity resonator for these modes, with resonance frequencies occurring at an electrical length of $\frac{\lambda}{4}$ and its multiples. Numerical investigations of TEM cell simulation models that include tapered sections are presented in \cite{990711}, while analytical approximations of the resonance frequencies for different modes in a TEM cell are given in \cite{Weil_Gruner_1984}.

Wave propagating in the TEM mode may excite higher order TE and TM modes due to material discontinuities or finite conductivity of the conducting plates \cite{10791592}. Such discontinuities require the electric and magnetic field to have a component in the direction of propagation, thereby exciting TE and TM modes. This leads to measurement uncertainties that are not present in numerical analysis.

Among the higher-order modes, the TE\textsubscript{10} and TE\textsubscript{01} modes are non-essential modes with the lowest cutoff frequencies. Their transverse electric field distributions are illustrated in \autoref{fig:transversal_e_fields_tem_cell}.

\autoref{tab:modes_tem_cell} shows some cut-off frequencies of these modes for different TEM cell dimensions. The focus for the remainder of this thesis lays on a TEM cell with the dimensions $a=40\,\mathrm{mm}$ and $b=24\,\mathrm{mm}$, for which the characteristic impedance of the output ports equals $Z_w=50\,\Omega$.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Field distributions}\label{sec:field_dist}

The normalized electric field intensity of the TEM mode is given as $\mathbf{e}^\pm_\mathrm{TEM}=e^\pm_\mathrm{TEM,x}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{a}}_y+e^\pm_\mathrm{TEM,y}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{a}}_y+e^\pm_\mathrm{TEM,z}\cdot \mathbf{\hat{a}}_z$ and normalized to $\sqrt{\mathrm{W}}$. The $x$- and $z$-component of $\mathbf{e}^\pm_\mathrm{TEM,x}$ is analytically approximated by

\begin{subequations}
	
	\begin{equation}
		e^\pm_\mathrm{TEM,x} = \frac{4}{a} Z_\mathrm{w}^{1/2} \sum_{m_o=1}^{\infty} 
		\frac{\sinh M(b/2 - py)}{\sinh M b/2} 
		\cdot \sin Mx \sin Ma/2 \; J_0(Mg),
		\label{eqn:eox_normalized}
	\end{equation}
	
	
	\begin{equation}
		e^\pm_\mathrm{TEM,y} = p\,\frac{4}{a}\, Z_\mathrm{w}^{1/2} \sum_{m_o=1}^{\infty}
		\frac{\cosh M(b/2 - py)}{\sinh M b/2}
		\cdot \cos Mx\, \sin Ma/2\, J_0(Mg).
		\label{eqn:eoy_normalized}
	\end{equation}
	
\end{subequations}

$Z_\mathrm{w}$ denotes the characteristic impedance of the TEM cell output port, $a$ its width and $b$ its height. The sign-function is defined as $p=1$ above the septum and $p=-1$ below it. The parameter $M=m_o\pi / 2a$, and $g$ represented the distance of the gap between the septum and the conducting wall. The index $m_o=1,3,5, ...$ iterates over odd integers. Both expressions are derived in \cite{Wilson_1981} using the procedure described in \cref{sec:tem_mode_tem_cell}. Analytical expression of higher-order modes are provided in \cite{Tippet_Chang_Crawford_1976} and not investigated further in this thesis.

In case of higher-order modes propagating, the analysis of the field distribution is conducted with the following assumptions. Each of the propagating modes is assumed to be orthogonal to each other, 

\begin{equation}
	\iint \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{n}^\pm\times \mathbf{h}_\mathrm{m}^\pm\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s'}=0 \quad\text{if}\quad n\neq m,
	\label{eqn:norm_power}
\end{equation}

with $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{n}^\pm$ and $\mathbf{h}_\mathrm{n}^\pm$ being the function vectors of the electric and magnetic field in transverse direction \cite{Collin_2015}. This indicates that the modes do not couple with each other, which is the case in an uniform waveguide with perfectly conducting walls, as discussed in \cref{sec:higher-order-modes}. Furthermore, each mode is normalized to $\sqrt{\mathrm{W}}$ as shown by

\begin{equation}
	\iint \mathbf{e}_\mathrm{n}^\pm\times \mathbf{h}_\mathrm{n}^\pm\mathrm{d}\mathbf{s'}=1.
	\label{eqn:unit_power}
\end{equation}

The radiated fields can then be described by a summation of normal modes, as in 

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\mathbf{E^+}&=\sum_na_n\mathbf{e}_n^+,    \label{eqn:a_modal_superposition1}\\
		\mathbf{H^+}&=\sum_na_n\mathbf{h}_n^+.    \label{eqn:a_modal_superposition2}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

And the fields propagating along the negative z-direction are expressed by \cite[p. 360]{Collin_2015}

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		\mathbf{E^-}&=\sum_na_n\mathbf{e}_n^-,   \label{eqn:b_modal_superposition1}\\
		\mathbf{H^-}&=\sum_na_n\mathbf{h}_n^-,   \label{eqn:b_modal_superposition2}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $\mathbf{h}_n^\pm$ is the normalized magnetic field intensity.

The coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ have units of $\sqrt{\mathrm{W}}$ and weight $\mathbf{e}_n^\pm$ and $\mathbf{h}_n^\pm$ of each mode. The field intensities at the outputs $\mathbf{E^\pm}$ and $\mathbf{H^\pm}$ are therefore decomposed into several propagating mode fields, each weighted with the corresponding coefficients. The derivation of $a_n$ and $b_n$ is discussed in \cref{sec:rad_source_tem}.

The normalized magnetic field intensity $\mathbf{h}^\pm_\mathrm{n}$ is derived in an analogous manner to $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{n}^\pm$. For the TEM mode, $\mathbf{h}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm$ can also be directly obtained from $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm$ with

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{h}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm = \pm \frac{1}{\eta_0}\mathbf{\hat{a}}_\mathrm{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm,
	\label{eqn:tem_h_e_relation}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_0 \approx 377\,\Omega$ is the free-space wave impedance.

The normalized electric field intensity $\mathbf{e}^\pm_\mathrm{TEM}$ of the TEM mode is a key parameter for determining the coupling between a source and the output ports of the TEM cell, as derived using the Lorentz reciprocity theorem discussed in \cref{sec:lorentz_theorem}. For example, \autoref{fig:outputpowereyoveroffset} shows the output power generated by an electric dipole moment $\mathbf{m}_e$ oriented along the $y$-direction. The dipole is displaced along the $x$-axis at the center height between the septum and the upper wall of the TEM cell, which has a width of $a=40\,\mathrm{mm}$ and a height of $b=24\,\mathrm{mm}$. 

The normalized electric field component in the $y$-direction $e_\mathrm{TEM,y}^\pm$ reaches its maximum magnitude at the center of the TEM cell, according to \autoref{eqn:eoy_normalized}. The integral form of the Lorentz reciprocity theorem in \autoref{eqn:lorentz_rec_theorem_int} states that this results in the largest output power. This behavior is confirmed by the results shown in \autoref{fig:outputpowereyoveroffset}. Analogously, the output power shown in \autoref{fig:outputpowereyoverheightwoffset} is largest close to the TEM cell wall, if the dipole moment is oriented in $x$-direction. Analysis of the field distribution is therefore useful to explain coupling behavior of electrically small antennas or dipole moments displaced within the TEM cell.

For this reason, \autoref{fig:norm_efield} shows the normalized electric field intensity in the TEM cell for both the $x$- and $y$-direction.

The normalized electric field of the TEM mode at $x=0$ is constant along the y-axis according to \autoref{eqn:eoy_normalized} and equals $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm=589.25\,\mathrm{V/m} \, \mathbf{\hat{a}}_y$ for the TEM cell width of $a=40\,\mathrm{mm}$ and height of $b=24\,\mathrm{mm}$.
