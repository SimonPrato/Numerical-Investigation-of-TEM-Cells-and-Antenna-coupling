\contentsline {todo}{The electric field / magnetic field distribution of the TEM mode must be known ($e_0$). Other mode distributions are neither available, nor necessary. Calculations to find these field distributions can be found in \blx@tocontentsinit {0}\cite {4091811}. This would also solve the problem with not being able to shift the location of the electric dipole moment. In \blx@tocontentsinit {0}\cite {Sreenivasiah_Chang_Ma_1981}, the normalized electric field was also determined analytically, just with output power. IMPORTANT!!! Additionally, the electric field at the output port and the dipole location must be equal (in tem mode) for the formula to work. If they are not, then the formulas derived in \blx@tocontentsinit {0}\cite {4091811} must be used. That's why the formula does not work for offset shift of the dipole moment anymore. The electric field at the incident port must then be found out. How to use this in case of a shielding material? Not valid for only ez dipole}{17}{section*.24}%
