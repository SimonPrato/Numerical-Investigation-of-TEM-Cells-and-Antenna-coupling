\subsection{Conceptual framework and modeling}

\subsubsection{Skin Effect}

The Skin-effect causes current to flow through a reduced area in a conductor, thus increasing resistance. The imaginary part $\kappa$ of the complex wave number $k$ is described by

\begin{equation}
	\kappa = \omega \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon \mu}{2}}\left[\sqrt{ 1+\left(\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon\omega}\right) ^2 } -1\right]^{1/2}.
	\label{eqn:kappa}
\end{equation}

The skin depth $d$ is responsible for the increased conductor losses and is expressed as 

\begin{equation}
	d = 1/\kappa.
	\label{eqn:skin_depth}
\end{equation}

For highly conductive materials $\left(\sigma \ll \epsilon\omega\right)$ the skin depth is $d \propto 1/\sqrt{\omega}$. Conductor losses $P_\mathrm{loss}$ are linearly proportional to the area of the conductor and therefore Skin-depth. They show the same dependency on the frequency $P_\mathrm{loss}\propto 1/\sqrt{\omega}$ \cite[p. 413]{Griffiths_2024}. Conductor losses contribute to the power consumption of the small loop antenna and is significantly larger than radiation power \cite[p. 231]{Balanis_1997}. 

The investigations in this thesis focus on the coupling behavior of antennas, including the radiation power consumed. All conducting surfaces in the simulation models are perfect electric conductors (PEC) to remove the impact of the Skin-effect.

%reduces the area in which the current flows, therefore increasing resistance. This appears due to the reduction of the depth, in which the electromagnetic waves enter. It is also called Skin depth and mathematically described by \autoref{eqn:skin_depth}. It depends on the imaginary part of the wave number $\kappa$, which is described in \autoref{eqn:kappa}. For high conducting materials $\left(\sigma >> \epsilon\omega\right)$, the dependency of the skin depth $d$ on the frequency can be described therefore as $d \propto 1/\sqrt{\omega}$. Since the power dispersion is linearly proportional to the area of the conductor and therefore Skin-depth, it shows the same dependency on the frequency $P_\mathrm{disp}\propto 1/\sqrt{\omega}$ \cite{Griffiths_2024}.

%\autoref{fig:deleteafter} shows the total power maintained in the system, meaning $S_{11}^2+S_{12}^2+S_{13}^2$. It does not add up to one, meaning that some energy is lost due to finite conductivity of the septum and antenna. This energy dispersion increases with frequency, most likely due to a decrease of the conductivity due to high-frequency effects like the Skin-effect. Consequently, the power consumption in \autoref{fig:currentlooppowerconsumption} shows a square root relation to the frequency, because the power dispersion is so high. When changing the material of the antenna and septum to a perfect electric conductor, the total power in a system remains one (no power is dispersed) and the power consumption over frequency of the antenna shows a quadratic relation to the frequency, due to the quadratic increase of the radiation resistance.
%
%
%
%At 1\,GHz, the dispersed power already equals to 0.46\,\%, which is much higher than the power transfer of the antenna to one waveport of 1.26e-5 at that frequency. Because this dispersed power is proportional to the square-root of the frequency $P_\mathrm{disp}\propto 1/\sqrt{\omega}$, the overall transferred power to the antenna shows the same characteristic. However, the power transfer to the waveports has a quadratic dependency on the frequency. %This, in turn, also leads to the unusual relation of the electric dipole moment to the frequency. 
%
%This dispersed power may be ignored in the simulations by changing the antenna's material (main source of power dissipation) and the septum from copper to a perfect electric conductor. The overall power in the system then remains at a constant one over the whole frequency range. Additionally, the transferred power to the antenna now has a quadratic relationship with the frequency, indicating increased radiation efficiency, previously described by \autoref{eqn:elec_rad_res}.

\subsubsection{Antenna models}

Every antenna is fed with a round feedpoint, shown in \autoref{fig:antennaport}. They provide an incident wave of unit power (1\,W). The antenna wires are modeled as PECs with a diameter of 0.2\,mm. The geometry is intentionally kept simple, with the cylindrical wires pointing either in x-, y- or z-direction, without combining multiple orientations. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{content/img/antenna_port}
	\caption{Geometry of an antenna's feedpoint used in simulation. The antenna is fed through a round waveport of diameter $0.46\,\mathrm{mm}$. The antenna consists of PEC wire with diameter of $0.2\,\mathrm{mm}$.	This geometry leads to a reference impedance of $Z_0\approx 50$\,$\Omega$.}
	\label{fig:antennaport}
\end{figure}




\subsubsection{TEM cell model}

The TEM cell model used has a width of $a=40$\,mm, a height of $b=24$\,mm and a length of $l=100$\,mm, shown in \autoref{fig:tem_cell_model}. The cell walls and septum are modeled as PECs. In the TEM cell simulation model, the tapered transition sections at the ports are omitted. This simplification allows unrestricted propagation of higher-order modes, facilitating investigations of their coupling behavior with antennas. \todo{reference section where I discussed this} The reference impedances of the output ports equal $Z_0 \approx 50\,\Omega$.

	\caption{Geometrical arrangement of the TEM cell used in simulations. The front shows the xy-plane, and the side the yz-plane of the TEM cell.}
	\label{fig:tem_cell_model}
\end{figure}

Upon exciting the output ports, the electric and magnetic energy $W_\mathrm{e}$ and $W_\mathrm{m}$ stored in the TEM cell is derived by \autoref{eqn:em_energy}. The current and voltage at the output ports is found with \crefrange{eqn:iin}{eqn:vin}. The capacitance and inductance of the TEM cell are given by \crefrange{eqn:l_m_energy}{eqn:c_e_energy}. The reactance values fluctuate negligibly over frequency likely due to numerical inaccuracies. The average capacitance and inductance values over the frequency range are chosen. It is assumed that the TEM cell has a constant capacitance and inductance of $C_\mathrm{T} = 6.74\,\mathrm{pF}$ and $L_\mathrm{T} = 16.25\,\mathrm{nH}$. 

\subsubsection{Dipole moments models}

A magnetic dipole moment can be expressed equivalently as either an electric current $I_0$ in a loop, or a magnetic current $I_\mathrm{m}$ in a line, as described in \autoref{eqn:magn_current_curr_loop}. All dipole moments used in the simulations are assumed to be of infinitesimal length, as discussed in \autoref{sec:infinitesimal_electric_dipoles} and \autoref{sec:mag_dip}. For infinitesimal magnetic dipoles, \autoref{eqn:magn_current_curr_loop} simplifies to 

\begin{equation}
	|\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{m}}|=j\omega\mu_0 |\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{0}}|,
	\label{eqn:m_mymag_ifa}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{m}}$ with the unit Vm denotes the magnetic dipole moment in the magnetic current representation, and $\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{0}}$ with the unit Am$^2$ the moment in the electric current representation \cite{10742020}. The simulation models represent magnetic dipole moments with $\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{m}}$, which will be used in further investigations.

The electric and magnetic dipole moments are placed at the center of the TEM cell at $x=0$, $y=b/2$, $z=0$. As discussed in \autoref{sec:field_dist}, $\mathbf{e}^\pm_\mathrm{TEM}(x=0, y=b/2, z=0)$ has only a y-component at this location, while $\mathbf{h}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm(x=0, y=b/2, z=0)$ has only an x-component. Consequently, the equivalent dipole moment $\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{e}}$ is oriented along the y-direction, and $\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{m}}$ along the x-direction.

Placing $\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\mathbf{m}_{\mathrm{e}}$ in the center of the TEM cell therefore significantly simplifies modeling electrically small antennas with equivalent dipole moments. This assumption is valid for the TEM mode. This configuration is assumed for all numerical investigations following in this thesis, unless otherwise stated.

All simulation results are counterchecked by inserting the equivalent dipole moments into the TEM cell and comparing the power and phase at the output ports with the antenna's results.

\subsubsection{Mesh settings}

\subsubsection{S-parameters and derived data}

The TEM cell with an antenna is modeled as a three-port network. The two output ports of the TEM cell are denoted as ports 1 and 2, while the antenna feedpoint is marked as port A. The behavior of this system is fully characterized by its scattering matrix, given as

\begin{equation}
	\left[S\right]=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{1A} \\
		S_{21} & S_{22} & S_{2A} \\
		S_{A1} & S_{A2} & S_{AA}
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The coupling between the antenna and the two ports of the TEM cell are described by S-parameters, specifically the forward transmission coefficients $S_{\mathrm{A1}}$ and $S_{\mathrm{A2}}$. The magnitude of this coefficient is the same for the antenna to both ports $|S_{\mathrm{A1}}|=|S_{\mathrm{A2}}|$, given that the antenna is placed far from the output ports. The power transferred from the antenna $P_{\mathrm{A}}$ to the output ports $P_{\mathrm{1}}$ and $P_{\mathrm{2}}$ is derived through
  
  \begin{equation}
  	P_{\mathrm{A}}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{1}}}{10^{|S_{\mathrm{A1}}|/10}}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{2}}}{10^{|S_{\mathrm{A2}}|/10}}.
  	\label{eqn:power_antenna}
  \end{equation}
  
  Consequently, if the normalized electric field distribution of the TEM mode $\mathbf{e^\pm}_\mathrm{TEM}$ is unknown, it may be derived by setting the output power of a waveport to $P_{\mathrm{1}}=P_{\mathrm{2}}=1/2\,\mathrm{W}$. For example, the uniformly distributed, normalized electric field of the TEM mode along the y-axis at the center of the TEM cell ($z=0$, $x=0$) is derived by
  
  \begin{equation}
  	|a_\mathrm{TEM}|\cdot\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^+(x=0,y,z=0)= \frac{\sqrt{P_\mathrm{1}Z_\mathrm{0}}}{b/2}.
  \end{equation}
  
  The difference in phase of $S_{\mathrm{A1}}$ and $S_{\mathrm{A2}}$ influences the magnitude of magnetic dipole moments and electric dipole moments, as discussed in \autoref{sec:equ-dip-mom}. 
%  In this case, a phase shift of $\pi$ indicates the presence of a magnetic dipole moment and the absence of electric dipole moments. This is shown by
%  
%  \begin{subequations}
%  	\begin{equation}
%  		\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{e} = \frac{a+b}{\mathbf{E}^\pm} = \frac{a+a\cdot e^{j\pi}}{\mathbf{E}^\pm} = 0,
%  	\end{equation}
%  	\begin{equation}
%  		\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{m} = j\frac{a-b}{\mathbf{E}^\pm\cdot k_0} = j\frac{a-a\cdot e^{j\pi}}{\mathbf{E}^\pm\cdot k_0} = j\frac{2a}{\mathbf{E}^\pm\cdot k_0}.
%  		\label{eqn:me_phase}
%  	\end{equation}
%  \end{subequations}
%  
%  A phase shift of zero indicates the opposite case. The influence of the electric and magnetic dipole moment is equal, if the phase shift equals $\pi/2$. 
   The peak value of the current through the feedpoint of the antennas is calculated with the S-parameters,
  
  \begin{equation}
  	I_{\mathrm{A}} = \sqrt{2P_{\mathrm{A}}}\frac{(1-S_{\mathrm{AA}})}{\sqrt{Z_0}}.
  	\label{eqn:iin}
  \end{equation}
  
  $P_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the incident power wave applied to the port. 
  The peak voltage at the feedpoint is calculated in a similar fashion as 
 
 \begin{equation}
 	V_{\mathrm{A}} = \sqrt{2P_{\mathrm{A}}}(1-S_{\mathrm{AA}})\sqrt{Z_0}.
 	\label{eqn:vin}
 \end{equation}
 
 Another method to derive voltages and currents is by integration of field intensities. Special care has to be taken at mesh refinement in the area of integration to reduce numerical errors. 
 
 The impedance seen from the antenna feedpoint is 
 
 \begin{equation}
 	Z_{\mathrm{A}}=Z_0\frac{1+S_{\mathrm{AA}}}{1-S_{\mathrm{AA}}}.
 \end{equation}
 
 All values are peak values, unless otherwise stated.

\end{figure}


The monopole antenna, shown in \autoref{fig:monopoleantenna}, is installed at the center of the TEM cell and connected to the feedpoint located on the top wall. It has a length of 5\,mm, which makes it electrically short at frequencies up to 6\,GHz. It may be approximated as an infinitesimal electric dipole for frequencies up to 1.25\,GHz. The equivalent dipole moments $\mathbf{m}_e$ and $\mathbf{m}_m$ are derived through \crefrange{eqn:ifa_me}{eqn:ifa_mm}. 

The frequency range investigated reaches from 1\,MHz to 3\,GHz. \autoref{fig:te01_te10_tem_propagation} demonstrates the cut-off frequencies of higher-order modes of the TEM cell in use for the simulation, where the cut-off frequency of TE\textsubscript{01} equals $f_{\mathrm{c,01}}=3.12\,\mathrm{GHz}$. The output power is influenced by the propagation of this evanescent mode, which must be considered in the simulation results in the upper frequency range.

\subsubsection{Equivalent dipole moments}
\FloatBarrier



The electric dipole moment is normalized to the free-space wave impedance to enable comparison with the magnetic dipole moment \cite{Kreindl_Bauernfeind_Weiss_Stockreiter_Kaltenbacher_2024}. The electric dipole moment shown in \autoref{fig:dipole_moments_monopole} increases approximately linearly over frequency, while the magnetic dipole moment is negligible over the whole frequency range. Consequently, the phase difference between the powers $\Delta = \varphi_2 - \varphi_1=0$ over the whole frequency range.

\todo{axis typo. Maybe show peak values?}

The electric current present in the monopole antenna is aligned with the electric field $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm$ of the dominant TEM mode present in the investigated frequency range. Only the the electric dipole moment in y-direction and the magnetic dipole moment in x-direction are needed to model the antenna, because they align with the fields of the TEM mode.

According to \autoref{eqn:J1_propagating_waves}, this will lead to a coupling with the output ports. \autoref{eqn:J1_propagating_waves} also requires $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm$ and the part of $I$ contributing to the output power to be in phase at the position of the monopole antenna, due to $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm$ and $\mathbf{h}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm$ being in-phase at the output ports. Using \crefrange{eqn:e_int_a}{eqn:e_int_b} and integrating the current $I$ in \autoref{fig:monopolefeedcurrent} yields

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{m}_e=\int_C \boldsymbol{\tau} I(l)\,dl = 82.00\,\upmu\mathrm{Am}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_z,
\end{equation}

which is equivalent to $\mathbf{m_e}=3.09\cdot 10^{-2} \cdot\mathbf{\hat{a}}_z\,\mathrm{Vm}$, if normalized to the free-space wave impedance $Z_0\approx 376.73\,\Omega$. Since the monopole antenna is located in the center, $\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{TEM}^\pm$ remains constant over $y$.

%For example, measuring the y-component of the electric field at the center of output port 1 yields $E_y^+(x=0, y, z=l/2)=15.35\,\mathrm{V/m}$, which is constant over $y$. \todo{differentiate somehow between normalized and normal electric field}. Using the Lorentz Reciprocity theorem \autoref{eqn:J1_propagating_waves}, and integrating $E_y^+(x=0, y, z=l/2)$ and $I(x=0, y, z=l/2)$ over the length of the monopole antenna yields \todo{all values must be peak values}

%\begin{equation}
%	\int_C E_y^+(x=0, y, z=l/2)\cdot I(x=0, y, z=l/2)\,dy=521.9\,\mathrm{\mu W}=2a^2.
%\end{equation}
%
%Applying \autoref{eqn:ifa_me} to then derive the electric dipole moment leads to 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\mathbf{m}_e = \sqrt{2}\frac{521.9\,\mathrm{W}}{\mathbf{E^\pm}}=
%\end{equation}




The voltage $V$ at the feedpoint in \autoref{fig:monopolefeedvoltage} remains largely constant over the frequency range. This agrees with the absence of magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}_m$, which is directly related to induced voltage according to \autoref{eqn:m_v}. The current $I$ at the feedpoint in \autoref{fig:monopolefeedcurrent} rises linearly. According to \autoref{eqn:me_i}, the frequency behavior of $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{e}$ is proportional to $I$. \autoref{eqn:me_i} cannot directly be applied using $I$, because some of this current returns as displacement current to the feedpoint (see \autoref{fig:monopolenearfield}), not contributing to the electric coupling. Furthermore, this agrees with the quadratically increasing output power in \autoref{fig:monopoleoutputpower} and the quadratically increasing radiation resistance determined.

The derived equivalent dipole moments $\mathbf{m}_e$, $\mathbf{m}_m$ positioned in the center of the TEM cell produce output power shown in \autoref{fig:monopolemomentcomp}, where they are compared with the monopole antenna. The approximation with the dipole moments worsens, when approaching the cut-off frequency of the first higher-order mode. The coefficients $a_{01}$ and $b_{01}$ of the TE\textsubscript{01} have to be considered, which would provide the difference in power to increase accuracy.

The output power rises quadratically over the frequency, which fits the linearly rising electric dipole moment and the quadratically rising radiation resistance determined in section \todo{Fill in}.

\todo[inline]{TODO: Improve Max delta S parameter reduction}



The distribution of the current along the monopole antenna shown in \autoref{fig:monopole_current_dist} is numerically derived by integrating the magnetic field intensity in a closed loop around the antenna at each position. 

Near the feedpoint at $0\,\mathrm{mm}$ non-linearities become apparent, due to significant displacement current in this region, as \autoref{fig:monopolenearfield} makes clear. This causes the current in the antenna to rapidly decreases in this section. 

The current distribution at $3\,\mathrm{GHz}$ (see \autoref{fig:currentdistributionmonopole}) approximates that of a small electric dipole as described in \autoref{sec:small_electric_dipole}. It shows an approximately linear decrease. Any current observed beyond the antenna length of $5\,\mathrm{mm}$ is attributed to displacement current to the septum, as is visible by the increased electric field there in \autoref{fig:monopolenearfield}.

The current distribution at $1\,\mathrm{MHz}$ demonstrated in \autoref{fig:currentloopchargedistribution1mhz} approximately follows the behavior of an infinitesimal electric dipole discussed in \autoref{sec:infinitesimal_electric_dipoles}. There, the current remains nearly constant over some sections of antenna length, decreasing towards the end. Additionally, the magnitude of the current is significantly lower at this frequency.

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{content/img/monopole_imp}

	\label{fig:monopoleimp}
\end{figure}


This frequency-dependent behavior is explained by the impedance of the monopole antenna shown in \autoref{fig:monopoleimp}. At low frequencies, the antenna impedance demonstrates a high magnitude, which rapidly decreases as frequency increases. Over the whole frequency range, it exhibits highly capacitive behavior, which is consistent with \autoref{eqn:compl_power_inf_elec_dipole}.


An equivalent circuit is derived in \autoref{fig:chucircuit}, which is known as Chu equivalent circuit for a short dipole \cite{Hansen_Collin_2013}.

\subsubsection{Current distribution on septum and antenna offset}
\FloatBarrier

\autoref{fig:monopole_surface_currents} shows the surface current density on the septum caused by the monopole antenna. The current heads towards output ports in-phase, which causes the output power to be in-phase, too. This is a characteristic of the dominant electric dipole moment, predicted by .

\end{figure}


\autoref{fig:monopole_surface_current_te01} shows the current density of the septum at 3.3\,GHz. Due to the magnetic fields propagating in the z-direction, the current on the septum creates a pattern of swirls. Current, which reach an output ports by following this pattern, contributes to the total power transferred by the TE\textsubscript{01} mode.

\todo[inline]{idea: offset in z-direction, show surface current how it gets a pahse shift at waveports, and a magnetic dipole moment appears to be induced}
\todo[inline]{idea: offset in x-direction, showing surface current and explaining the decrease in power transfer (normal E-field distribution)}

If only the TEM mode propagates, only the y-component of an electric dipole moment and the x-component of a magnetic dipole moment generates output power, assuming they are centrally located ($x=0$, $y=b/4$, $z=0$). This is due to the magnetic field containing only an x-component $\mathbf{h}^\pm = h_x^\pm e^{\pm k_0 z}$, and the electric field only an y-component $\mathbf{e}^\pm = e_y^\pm e^{\pm k_0 z}$ at the center of the TEM cell. \todo{Sketch this situation. Also, $e^{\pm k_0 z}$ indicated that at z=0 the dipole moment is located. Consider this in all sketches}
An offset of dipole moments or propagation of higher order modes lead to different field components of $\mathbf{h}^\pm$ and $\mathbf{e}^\pm$, and therefore to a change in coupling. These effects are investigated numerically in \autoref{sec:dipole_moments}.

A square loop antenna is placed in the center of the TEM cell. Each side has a length of 1.6\,mm, hence it is electrically short for frequencies up to 4.69\,GHz. The square form is preferable to a round antenna in the following numerical simulations, due to more accurate mesh modeling and clearer investigation of the resulting dipole moments. The normal vector of the loop surface points in x-direction. The frequency investigated ranges from 1\,MHz to 3\,GHz, unless otherwise stated, and the input power of the antenna remains at 1\,W.

The dipole moments are plotted in \autoref{fig:dipole_moments_loop_antenna}. The amount of magnetic flux passing through the area of the loop antenna lead to the large magnitude of $\mathbf{m}_m$, as described by \crefrange{eqn:e_a_closed_int}{ eqn:e_b_closed_int} and \autoref{eqn:m_v}. $\mathbf{m}_e$ is created by the current in the loop antenna according to \crefrange{eqn:e_int_a}{ eqn:e_int_b}, which partially points in direction of $\mathbf{e}^\pm_\mathrm{TEM}$. Opposed to the case of a monopole antenna, $\mathbf{m}_e$ and $\mathbf{m}_m$ demonstrate non-linear behavior over frequency, which is investigated further in \autoref{sec:loop_electrical_characteristics}.

The current $I$ in the loop antenna changes along the antenna wire as shown in \autoref{fig:loopfeedreturncurrent}, indicating displacement current coupling back to the septum and back to the feedpoint, also seen in the slightly changing magnetic field intensity in \autoref{fig:loopnearfield}. The difference between the feedpoint and return path current increases over frequency. Consequently, $\mathbf{m}_e$ gains a significant magnitude according to \autoref{eqn:me_i}, influencing the electric coupling behavior of the antenna. The feedpoint current is derived through integration of $\mathbf{H}$ in a closed loop of radius 0.11\,mm, measured 0.17\,mm above the feedpoint. The return path current is measured at the same height above the PEC surface. The results vary with position due of the displacement currents in the antenna's near-field.

\todo[inline]{Insert free-space PEC loop simulations.}

\autoref{fig:loopfeedvoltage} demonstrates the voltage at the feedpoint of the antenna, which significantly rises over the frequency. Because the increase in voltage leads to larger displacement current according to \autoref{eqn:me_i}, $\mathbf{m}_e$ follows its frequency-behavior. Similarly, the reduction in current over frequency, shown in \autoref{fig:loopfeedcurrent}, leads a lower induced voltage, and according to \autoref{eqn:m_v} a smaller magnitude of $\mathbf{m}_m$. The current and the voltage are determined with \cref{eqn:vin,eqn:iin}.



The increases in voltage and decrease in current follows from the impedance, depicted in \autoref{fig:currimp}. The strongly inductive impedance increases linearly over frequency, keeping the input power constant leads to the observed behavior.

\subsubsection{Equivalent circuit model}
A better understanding and an useful model for calculations is an equivalent circuit model. \autoref{fig:eqc_balanis} demonstrates an equivalent circuit for the electrically small loop antenna, where $C$ models stray capacitances, $R_L$ the losses, $R_r$ the radiation, $L_i$ the internal inductance and $L_A$ the external inductance \cite[p. 244] {Balanis_1997}. The model used in the simulation consists of a perfect conductor, therefore $R_L$ and $L_A$ are neglected. Instead, the simplified schematic in \autoref{fig:eqc_simple} is used, where $R_A$, $L_A$ and $C_A$ model the impedance behavior of the antenna.

The antenna is placed on a PEC surface in an open space. \todo{sketch}The inductance and capacitance are derived according to \autoref{eqn:m_energy}, in the case of the circuit in \autoref{fig:eqc_simple} this leads to

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
	L = 2\frac{W_m}{I_{in}^2} = \frac{V_{in}^2}{2\omega^2W_m},
	\end{equation}
 	\begin{equation}
 	C = \frac{2W_c}{V_{in}^2}.
 	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

\todo[inline]{Plot inductance and capacitance}

In the investigated frequency range, the inductive impedance is significantly smaller than the capacitive impedance, resulting in a predominantly inductive antenna behavior. The model further demonstrates, that the input voltage increases over frequency, therefore increasing the voltage drop across the capacitor. Physically, this corresponds to increased displacement current and electric coupling. 

The result cross-checked with 

\begin{equation}
	L_A = \frac{2\mu_0 l}{\pi} \left[ \ln\!\left(\frac{l}{w_r}\right) - 0.774 \right],
	\label{eqn:ind_approx}
\end{equation}

which is an approximation of the inductance of a square current loop in free-space \cite[p. 245]{Balanis_1997}. There, $l$ is the length of one side of the antenna, and $w_r$ is the wire radius. \autoref{eqn:ind_approx} yields $L=2.32\,\mathrm{nH}$ for the loop antenna in investigation.

The model is extended in \autoref{fig:full_circuit} with an equivalent circuit of the TEM cell, which consists of an equivalent inductance $L_T=L_{T1}+L{T2}$ and capacitance $C_T = C_{T1}+C_{T2}$. After checking the frequency range in which the equivalent circuit of the TEM cell is valid, it is connected with the circuit of the antenna with $C_k$, which models the coupling through displacement current, and the mutual inductances $M_{A,T1}$ and $M_{A,T2}$, which correspond to coupling through induced voltages. The mutual inductances are given as

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V} = j\omega \begin{bmatrix}
	L_{A} & M_{A,T1} & M_{A,T2} \\
	M_{T1,A} & L_{T1} & 0 \\
	M_{T2,A} & 0 & L_{T2}
\end{bmatrix} \mathbf{I}.
\end{equation}

Due to the modeling of the power transfer with $C_k$, $M_{A,T1}$ and $M_{A,T2}$, the radiation resistance of the antenna shown in \autoref{fig:eqc_simple} is neglected.

%A fine mesh is important due to the near-fields of the antenna. Coarse meshes lead to bad modeling the the fields near the antenna, leading to bad current and voltage calculations in the antenna. A large part of this happens due to bad modeling of the displacement current near the port. Especially small values which are important, such as the capicitance responsible for electric coupling of the antenna, heavily suffer from the numerical error.

\subsubsection{Current distribution on septum and higher order modes}

The loop antenna generates a current on the septum of the TEM cell, as shown in \autoref{fig:loop_surface_current}. At a frequency of 3\,GHz, the current arrives at the output ports out of phase, as visible in \autoref{fig:current_loop_surface_current}. This agrees with \autoref{eqn:me_phase}, which predicts a 180\textdegree  phase shift in case of a pure magnetic dipole moment.

\todo[inline]{TODO: log scale in \autoref{fig:loopsurfacecurrentsoffsetrotation3ghz3plot}. Broader frequency range.}

When the position of the current loop antenna is rotated by 90\textdegree and contains an offset of $x=7\,\mathrm{mm}$, the transmission of power is not possible. As visible in the current distribution \autoref{fig:loopsurfacecurrentsoffsetrotation}, there is no wave propagation and the surface current remains reactive, forming circles around magnetic fields. 

At a frequency of 3.3\,GHz, the TE\textsubscript{01} mode start to propagate, visible in \autoref{fig:loopsurfacecurrentsoffsetrotation3ghz3}. A large proportion of the current now reaches the output ports, providing output power, which is in-phase as opposed to the previous case. The propagation occurs due to the alignment of the current loop with the magnetic field lines in longitudinal direction, which leads to power transfer according to \cref{eqn:e_a_closed_int,eqn:e_b_closed_int}. The output power increases sharply, as demonstrated in \autoref{fig:loopsurfacecurrentsoffsetrotation3ghz3plot}.

%The current and voltage drops along the wire are not constant.

Consequently, the power consumed by the first part is much higher than by the latter \todo{Insert power consumption plots of each antenna section}. Additionally, this difference in power consumption increases slightly over frequency. 

%The electric current reduces over the wire because of the displacement current to the septum and the ground plane. As visible in the charge density plot in \autoref{fig:currentloopcurrentdistribution} and the electric field plot in \autoref{fig:currentloopnearefield}, much of the displacement current occurs near the feedpoint and at the wire parallel to the septum.

%\autoref{fig:currentloopfeedcurrent} and \autoref{fig:currentloopvoltagedrop} show the current and voltage consumption of the antenna. The phase shift equals $\phi\approx89.80\circ$, which hints to a strong inductive behavior. The inductance is determined to be $L\approx2.15\,\mathrm{nH}$. The capacitance is very low, but does lead so some displacement current. The frequency behavior of the voltage and current interchange if the antenna is strongly capacitive, as it the case in a monopole antenna.




%Next, the electric and magnetic near field is investigated. The wave impedance $Z=E/H$ shown in \autoref{fig:waveimpedanceloop} in the center of the loop rises linearly over frequency. At low frequencies, the wave impedance is very low, which confirms the inductive behavior of the antenna. However, as the frequency increases, so does the voltage drop. This may be analogous to a inductor in an electrical circuit, across which the voltage drop also increases with frequency $U = \mathrm{i}L\omega I$. 


%\autoref{eqn:a_b_moments_simp} relates the dipole moments to the output power. The influence of the dipole moments is determined by the electric field at the electric dipole moment and the magnetic field at the magnetic dipole moment. In this formula, the electric and magnetic field are simply related through the free-space wave impedance. However, as visible in \autoref{fig:waveimpedanceloop}, the wave impedance at the location of the dipole moments (i.e. at the antenna) is much lower. Additionally, it rises linearly with the frequency. This influence of the antenna itself on the fields around the dipoles could explain the non-linear relation of the dipole moments to the frequency.



%\autoref{fig:currentlooppowerconsumption} shows the power consumption of the antenna, which is influenced by two factors. The radiation resistance rises quadratically with the frequency. At the same time, the impedance increases, leading to higher matching and therefore to a higher power transfer. This is contrary to the monopole antenna, where the impedance is decreases over the frequency, again leading to better impedance matching, because the impedance was high to begin with. The source impedance is 50\,$\Omega$.



%The current-loop antenna contains two electric dipoles, shifted in phase by 180°. They therefore oppose each other in the power transfer to the waveports. However, as visible in the electric near field plot in \autoref{fig:currentloopvoltagedrop}, the electric dipole moment from node A to the feedpoint is much larger than the one from node B to ground. The reason can be demonstrated by representing the antenna with its nodes in \autoref{fig:current_loop_ua_ub}. The partial inductances in this schematic are much larger than the capacitances. This leads to a large voltage drop between node A and B, and therefore a weaker electric dipole moment at node B.

%Additionally, this voltage difference $V_\mathrm{A}-V_\mathrm{B}$ rises linearly over the frequency, due to the linearly increasing impedance of the inductance $\mathrm{i}\omega L$. This means, that the over electric dipole moment a quadratic relationship to the frequency has.

%Further, \autoref{fig:loopwaveimp} shows the wave impedance of the near-fields at the loop antenna. The \autoref{eqn:a_b_moments_simp} shows, that the influence of the dipoles depends on the electric and magnetic fields at the dipoles position. The electric and magnetic fields are related through the wave impedance $Z = E/H$. If the wave impedance rises linearly over frequency, the electric field increases over the magnetic fields, giving more influence to the electric dipole moments. As previously discussed, there are two electric dipole moments in this antenna, benefiting from that. \todo{Monopole antenna: Also change in wave impedance, but there is not really a magnetic dipole moment} 

%The wave impedance $Z_\mathrm{w}$ in the near field of the electrically small loop antenna is approximated by \autoref{eqn:wave_impedance_loop}. It confirms the linear relationship of the near-field wave impedance to the frequency. \todo{Source: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field}{Wikipedia}.

\subsubsection{Influence of antenna's geometry}
\FloatBarrier

The antenna's geometry influences the coupling behavior. To demonstrate this, the loop antennas presented in are simulated, and their dipole moments and power consumption compared. 

The behavior of the magnetic dipole moments $\mathbf{m}_m$ are equal in all cases according to \crefrange{eqn:e_a_closed_int}{eqn:e_b_closed_int}, since the total area of the loop antenna remains the same. Non-linearities persist, due to almost unchanging capacitance of the antenna to the upper PEC plane, causing increasing displacement current over frequency.

\subsection{Loop antenna with gap}\label{sec:loop_gap_sim}
\subsubsection{Setup and geometrical analysis}
\FloatBarrier
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{content/img/gapped_loop_antenna}
	\caption{Geometry of loop antenna with a gap in the return path inserted in the TEM cell.}
	\label{fig:gappedloopantenna}
\end{figure}

The geometry of the loop antenna with a gap is similar to that of the loop antenna discussed in \autoref{sec:loop_sim}. A gap is present with $10\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ height in the return path, as shown in \autoref{fig:gappedloopantenna}. The magnetic coupling is determined with \crefrange{eqn:e_a_closed_int}{eqn:e_b_closed_int}, leading to 

\begin{equation}
	-\oint_C \boldsymbol{\tau} I(l) \cdot\mathbf{e}_n^\pm  dl= -\int_\text{wire} \boldsymbol{\tau} I_\text{wire}(l) \cdot\mathbf{e}_n^\pm  dl -\int_\text{gap} \boldsymbol{\tau} I_\text{gap}(l) \cdot\mathbf{e}_n^\pm  dl.
\end{equation}

The electric current in the gap is $I_\mathrm{gap}=0\,\mathrm{A}$, while the current in the antenna wire $I_\mathrm{wire}$ is significantly reduced due to the interrupted current path. Consequently, the magnetic coupling between the loop antenna with a gap and the TEM cell is expected to be lower than that of the loop antenna without a gap.

The conductors around the gap act as capacitors, accumulating charges on both sides. This leads to a higher potential in the wire of the antenna. The electric coupling increases significantly, according to \crefrange{eqn:charges_a}{eqn:charges_b}. Concluding, the structure of the loop antenna with the gap suggests capacitive behavior with a dominating electric dipole moment.

\todo[inline]{TODO: Some sources state that electrically small antennas must be either strongly capacitive or inductive. This would mean, that small antennas can always be represented by the same model: Either dominating electric dipole moment in the capacitive antenna case, with a non-linear behavior of the high frequencies, or a magnetic dipole moment with the same property in the inductive antenna case. The frequency, at which the non-linearities occur, depend on the amount of capacitance or inductance, i.e. the Q-factor. A high Q-factor leads to non-linearities in lower cut-off frequencies, and a low Q-factor increases the cut-off frequency. A capacitive antenna with low impedance has a high Q-factor. A inductive antenna with high impedance has a high Q-factor. This can practically be read from the impedance graphs. Can a relation between the impedance/Q-factor and a ``cut-off frequency'' of the dipole moments be established?}

\todo[inline]{TODO: A little thought experiment on the gapped loop antenna demonstrates why this is the case: If the magnetic dipole moment shall be increased in this antenna, the height of the gap can be decreased to increase the current flow and therefore the magnetic coupling. Ironically, this also increases the amount of charges accumulating on the boundaries of the gap, therefore increasing the electric coupling and capacitive behavior. The capacitive behavior can therefore not change, unless the gap is completely removed. Also, the decrease in gap leads to larger total energy transfer and a higher Q-factor. I suspect, that a high Q-factor of an antenna leads to high energy transfer. This would make sense, because a high Q-factor indicates increased near-field intensities, that would naturally couple with the tem cell. A simulation showing the dipole moments for different gap heights over the frequency would support this claim.}

\subsubsection{Equivalent dipole moments}
\FloatBarrier

The electric dipole moment shown in \autoref{fig:gappedloopmoments} clearly dominates over the magnetic dipole moment. The dipole moments behave non-linearly over the frequency.

	\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}



\autoref{fig:gappedloopcompmomentsgapsweep} demonstrates the effect of the gap height on the dipole moments' behavior. A larger gap height leads to an decreased charge charge concentration in the gap region, consequently a smaller magnitude of the electric dipole moment $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{e}$. Additionally, it also leads to a decrease in electric current $\mathbf{J}$ in the antenna, reducing the magnetic dipole moment $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{m}$. The reduction in the magnitude of $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{e}$ and $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{m}$ with increasing gap height is reflected in the decreasing output power shown in \autoref{fig:gappedloopcomppowergapsweep}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}

	\end{subfigure}
	
	\caption{Comparison of dipole moments and output power at different gap heights.}
	\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

An increase in gap height reduces the non-linearities in $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{e}$ and $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{m}$. The voltage drop across the gap and the charge accumulation remains stabler over frequency. A small gap leads to both an increase in current and inductance, therefore creating a large voltage drop and influencing $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{e}$ and $\mathbf{m}_\mathrm{m}$.

The gap leads to a significant reduction of electric current. Consequently, the impedance of the antenna shows capacitive behavior, as indicated in \autoref{fig:gappedloopim}. The energy transfer to the TEM cell occurs primarily by displacement current, explaining the dominating electric dipole moment due to \autoref{eqn:me_i}.

\subsection{Inverted F-antenna}\label{sec:ifa_sim}

\todo[inline]{TODO}

The inverted F-antenna (IFA) is modeled in Ansys HFSS as shown in \autoref{fig:ifa}. It is positioned at the center of the TEM cell, mounted at the top surface. The 5\,mm long wire points towards waveport 2. The excitation is a modal wave port. With a maximum dimension of 5\,mm, the antenna is electrically small for a frequency of up to 6\,GHz, at which it will be a tenth of the wavelength. In this simulation, the antenna is investigated for the frequency of 100\,MHz to 1\,GHz. The TEM cell has a width of 40\,mm and a height of 24\,mm and an impedance of $\sim50\,\Omega$. The goal is to find equivalent dipole moments of the antenna.

\autoref{fig:dipole_moments_over_freq_ifa} shows the dipole moments over frequency. The electric dipole moment $m_e$ has been normalized to the free-space wave impedance of $377\,\Omega$ to make the dipole moments comparable. This is possible because the dipole moments are interchangeable through the wave impedance \cite[p. 414]{Jackson}. The antenna input power has been set to 142588.47\,W, because this leads to an output power of 1\,W at a frequency of 1\,GHz. The magnetic dipole moment is much larger than the electric dipole moment, because the current loop of the antenna is aligned with the TEM cell's magnetic fields, but the line current is not with the TEM electric fields. The magnetic dipole moments rises linearly with the frequency, which is equal to a quadratic increase of power. Only the TEM modes has been considered in the simulation, as other modes disturb the calculations. 



\todo{Repeat for different orientations? Change variable name: TEM cell height.}

The magnetic coupling with the septum happens due to the alignment of the current loop with the magnetic field of the dominant TEM mode. The antenna is now rotated by 90° around the z-axis, such that the magnetic current loop stands perpendicular to the magnetic TEM fields. \autoref{fig:phase_shift_90_ifa} demonstrates the phase of the S-parameters, describing the coupling of antenna to waveport 1 and 2. Since the magnetic dipole moment is responsible for a phase between the ports, \autoref{fig:phase_shift_90_ifa} strongly hints to an absence of it.


\autoref{dipole_moments_ifa_90} shows that the electric dipole moment $m_\mathrm{e}$ has stayed the same, while the magnetic dipole moment became zero. Consequently, the overall power transfer between the antenna and the waveports is also much lower. 

\todo{The same procedure was repeated with different dipole moments positions, for which \autoref{eqn:e0z_mse} worked. Maybe do a general equation for the normalized e-field?}

\subsection{Center Fed Monopole Antenna}

\todo[inline]{TODO}

The center fed monopole antenna is shown in \autoref{fig:center_fed_monopole}. The conducting plane in \autoref{fig:center_fed_monopole} is on the top side of the TEM cell, thus the image is rotated counter-clockwise by 90 degrees. The electric wire with the length of 5 mm points towards the septum. The 1.1 x 1.6 mm loop is again aligned with the magnetic field lines of the TEM mode. The antenna is fed with a power of $P_\mathrm{Antenna}=127770.39\,\mathrm{W}$, which once more leads to an output power of $P_\mathrm{Out}=1\,\mathrm{W}$ at 1\,GHz at both output ports.

\todo[inline]{A question on my mind since the beginning of this thesis: Can how is the magnetic dipole moment influenced by rotating this geometry by 90 degrees? Is the magnetic dipole moment higher or lower than in the rotated loop antenna? With my current knowledge, I suspect that the electric dipole moment leads to current coupling with the TEM cell over displacement current, therefore leading to a smaller magnetic dipole moment then in the case of the loop antenna}

The magnitude of $|S_\mathrm{A1}|=|S_\mathrm{A2}|$ in \autoref{fig:forward_coeff_cfm} shows stronger coupling. As will be seen below, this is because of an increased electric dipole moment, while the magnetic dipole moment remained the same. Therefore, the center fed monopole antenna couples well electrically with the TEM cell.

\autoref{fig:dipole_moment_cfm} shows that the magnetic dipole moments of the inverted F and center fed monopole antennas are equal. This is due to the same size of the current loops. However, the electric dipole moments increased for the center fed monopole antenna. The alignment of the line current with the TEM cell's electric field causes this. (antenna power = 126549.7191667088\,W)

The output power has been scaled as in the simulation before. This leads to the same electric field magnitude. Therefore, the electric field and output power over frequency plot are the same as in the case for the inverted F antenna, visible in \autoref{fig:output_power_e_fields_over_freq_ifa}.


When rotating this antenna by 79°, the electric and magnetic dipole moment influence the output power by roughly the same amount, as visible in \autoref{fig:79cfm}. This makes itself manifest by a phase shift of around 45°  between the output powers of the waveports. Interestingly, both the electric and the magnetic dipole moment demonstrate a non-linear behavior. \todo{Why does the magnetic moment sink?}

\todo{CFM at 90° rotation still demonstrates magnetic dipole moment, opposed to current loop. Does this scale with antenna height, i.e. electric dipole moment?}

%\subsubsection{Serial Loop Antenna}
%
%This section will discuss the antenna displayed in \autoref{fig:serialloopantenna}. The idea of that antenna is to create two magnetic dipole moments, which are in phase. As the frequency increases, the displacement current between the loops becomes larger, thus reducing the current through and weakening the second loop. The dipole moments in \autoref{fig:serialloopantennadipolemoments} demonstrate a non-linear behavior of the magnetic dipole moment (only very weakly recognizable, but with a geometry sweep this becomes clearer \todo{Find a geometry where this effect is much stronger}). Also, it would be interesting to measure the wave impedances in both loops over the frequency. Also, find the current distributions, add current plots and electric fields, charge distributions.
