\subsection{Shielding}

Effective shielding is of great interest to reduce EMI of electronic systems. A figure of merit for shielding capabilities of a material is the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (SE), given in \autoref{eqn:se_elec_fields} \cite{10518640}. $E_\mathrm{i}$ is the incident electric field, while $E_\mathrm{t}$ is the transmitted electric field, also depicted in \autoref{fig:shielding_material_diagram}. It depends on the thickness and shape of the material, and its electric and magnetic properties. Additionally, the TEM cell contributes to the SE values.

Should I add wave reflections formula?

\begin{equation}
    SE_{\mathrm{dB}}=20\log{(\frac{E_\mathrm{i}}{E_\mathrm{t}})}
    \label{eqn:se_elec_fields}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

(Note: Higher order modes may be able to propagate in the TEM cell, as the refraction of the shielding material follows to excitation of these modes.)

An electromagnetic wave may undergo several reflections inside the shielding material, with each reflection adding up to the total reflected, absorbed and transmitted waves. The total shielding effectiveness is therefore determined by \autoref{eqn:se_rereflections}, according to Schelkunoff. $A_{\mathrm{dB}}$ represents the absorption losses traveling through the shield, $R_{\mathrm{dB}}$ the reflection losses, and $B_{\mathrm{dB}}$ is the correction factor for the multiple reflections inside the shield \cite{10518640}.

\begin{equation}
    SE_{\mathrm{dB}}=R_{\mathrm{dB}}+A_{\mathrm{dB}}+B_{\mathrm{dB}}
    \label{eqn:se_rereflections}
\end{equation}
