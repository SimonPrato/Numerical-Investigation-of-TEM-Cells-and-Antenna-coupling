The results of these separate methods agree within the precision shown. As expected from \eqref {eqn:cutoff_frequency_rect_waveguide}, the TE\textsubscript {10} cutoff frequency depends only on $a$ and is independent of $b$, consistent with rectangular waveguide theory. The TE\textsubscript {01} cutoff frequency varies with both $a$ and $b$.}}{20}{table.caption.15}%
