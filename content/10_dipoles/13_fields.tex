\subsection{Field regions}

The field quantities $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ have been derived for an infinitesimal electric dipole in \cref{eqn:e_er,eqn:e_et,eqn:e_ep} and \cref{eqn:e_hr,eqn:e_hpt}. They are valid everywhere except for the source region \cite[p. 156]{Balanis_1997}. Depending on the distance $r$ to the dipole, the behavior of the fields changes. This becomes apparent when investigating $E_\theta$ in \autoref{eqn:e_et}, specifically expressions 1 and 2 in

\begin{equation}
	E_\theta = j\eta \frac{kI_0 d \sin \theta }{4\pi r}\left[ 1 + \underbrace{\frac{1}{jkr}}_{\text{expression 1}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{(kr)^2}}_{\text{expression 2}} \right] \mathrm{e}^{-jkr}.
	\label{eqn:e_et_2}
\end{equation}

If the distance $r < \lambda/2\pi$ $(kr < 1)$, then expression 2 dominates the value in the brackets. Consequently, the energy stored in this region is mostly imaginary. It is referred to as the near-field region.

At $r = \lambda/2\pi$ $(kr = 1)$, expression 1 and 2 are of equal magnitude. This leads to the energy stored \todo{Continue}

\todo[inline]{In case of a short dipole, the field regions change as shown below.}


The region around an antenna may be divided into three sub-regions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reactive near-field region
	\item Radiating near-field or Fresnel region
	\item Far-field or Fraunhofer region
\end{itemize}

They are shown in \autoref{fig:fieldregionsantenna}. These regions are distinguished for most antennas using the wavelength $\lambda$ and the largest dimension of the antenna $D$. The nearest region to the antenna, the reactive near-field region, is a sphere with radius $R_1$, which is calculated with \autoref{eqn:region_r1}. It is characterized by the predominantly reactive fields in it. The next region, the radiating near-field region, is located around the first, within a sphere of radius $R_2$ calculated in \autoref{eqn:region_r2}. In there, the radiating fields dominate and the angular field distribution is dependent on the distance to the antenna. In the largest and last region, the far-field region, the angular field distribution is independent of the distance to the antenna \cite{Balanis_1997}.

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
		R_1=0.62\sqrt{D^3/\lambda}
		\label{eqn:region_r1}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	R_2=2D^2/\lambda
	\label{eqn:region_r2}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

The electrically short antennas located in the TEM cell interact with it mostly through the reactive near-field region. However, if the TEM cell is large and frequencies are high, the coupling occurs over the radiating near-field. There, the field distributions are different, hence the dipole moments couple differently over frequency to the cell. \todo[inline]{Is this even possible without reaching other modes behavior? And demonstrate the fields over frequency and distance, which changes differently in different regions}.

An infinitesimal dipole is taken as an antenna. The fields are calculated through the auxiliary fields, as described earlier by \autoref{eqn:elec_and_mag_field_dipole}, which leads to \autoref{eqn:inf_dipole_h_field} for the magnetic field strength and \autoref{eqn:inf_dipole_e_field} for the electric field strength. Those equations are valid everywhere, except for the source point \cite{Balanis_1997}.

\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:inf_dipole_h_field}
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hr_htheta}
		H_r = H_\theta = 0
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hphi}
		H_\phi = j \frac{k I_0 l \sin \theta}{4 \pi r}
		\left[ 1 + \frac{1}{j k r} \right] e^{-j k r}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}


\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:inf_dipole_e_field}
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:er}
		E_r = \eta \frac{I_0 l \cos \theta}{2 \pi r^2} 
		\left[ 1 + \frac{1}{jkr} \right] e^{-jkr}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:etheta}
		E_\theta = j \eta \frac{k I_0 l \sin \theta}{4 \pi r} 
		\left[ 1 + \frac{1}{jkr} - \frac{1}{(kr)^2} \right] e^{-jkr}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ephi}
		E_\phi = 0
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

The distance of $\lambda / 2\pi$, leading to $kr = 1$, is called radian distance, where $r$ is the distance to the antenna and $k$ is the free-space wave number. There, the real and imaginary part for both $H_\phi$ and $E_r$ is equal. Furthermore in $E_\theta$, only the $1/(jkr)$ term contributes to the field, because the other terms cancel each other out. The radian distance essentially marks a point of equal imaginary and stored power \cite{Balanis_1997}.

In distances smaller than the radian distance $kr<1$, the fields are largely reactive and located in a reactive near-field region. There, the field strength decreases with the cube of the distance ($\propto 1/r^3$).  
At distances beyond the radian distance (kr > 1), in the intermediate-field region, the field strength decreases with the square of the distance ($\propto 1/r^2$) \cite{Balanis_1997}. This behavior is visualized in \autoref{fig:energyfieldsregions}.

The wave-number $k$ is dependent on the frequency. Therefore, when placing an infinitesimal dipole into a TEM cell, its coupling behavior depends on the distance and the field regions, that couple. For that reason, the $kr$ number shall be investigated over the whole frequency range for different distances.
