# Numerical Investigation of TEM Cells and Antenna Coupling (in Work)
## Summary
This thesis project investigates the coupling between magneto-electric short antennas and TEM cells. This is done by deriving there equivalent electric and magnetic dipole moments,
which are an effective representation of the radiation patterns of electrically short conducting structures. Different aspects of the antennas, such as postion, rotation, frequency-behavior are discussed.
All of this is undermined with theoretical background knowledge, which is discussed in this work. The goal is to deeply understand the coupling 
of electrically conducting structures with the TEM cell, such that products may be improved to pass EMC compliance tests.

## File Structure

- **Documentation.pdf** describes all work done in this thesis.
- **Simulations** contains all Ansys HFSS files used for simulations.
- **Scripts** has all (mostly Python) scripts used to process data, such as the derivation of electric and magnetic coupling out of the S-Parameters from the numerical simulations.
- In the **LaTeX** folder all files necessary to compile Documentation.pdf are located.
- Lastly, the **Archive** folder is used for files not needed anymore, but useful for future reference.

## Additional Information
This project is done with the Technical University of Graz. It started in July 2025 and is in progress and open-ended.
