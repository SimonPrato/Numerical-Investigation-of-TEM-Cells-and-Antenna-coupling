The field quantities $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ have been derived for an infinitesimal electric dipole in \cref{eqn:e_er,eqn:e_et,eqn:e_ep} and \cref{eqn:e_hr,eqn:e_hpt}, further for an infinitesimal magnetic dipole in \cref{eqn:m_hr,eqn:m_ht,eqn:m_hp} and \cref{eqn:m_ert,eqn:m_ep}. They are valid everywhere except for the source region \cite[p. 156]{Balanis_1997}.

The behavior of the fields depends on the distance $r$ from the dipole. This dependence becomes evident by investigating the terms $1/(jkr)$ and $1/(kr)^2$ appearing in \cref{eqn:e_er,eqn:e_et,eqn:e_ep} and \cref{eqn:e_hr,eqn:e_hpt} for the infinitesimal electric dipole. For clarity, these terms are highlighted in the expression for $E_\theta$ in \cref{eqn:e_et_2}, although they also partially appear in $E_r$ and $H_\phi$. They are denoted as Expression~1 and Expression~2, respectively:

\begin{equation}
	E_\theta = j\eta \frac{kI_0 d \sin \theta }{4\pi r}\left[ 1 + \underbrace{\frac{1}{jkr}}_{\text{Expression 1}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{(kr)^2}}_{\text{Expression 2}} \right] \mathrm{e}^{-jkr}.
	\label{eqn:e_et_2}
\end{equation}



If the distance $r < \lambda/2\pi$ (or equivalently, $kr < 1$), then Expression~2 delivers the largest value in the brackets. Consequently, the energy stored in this region is predominantly imaginary. This region is referred to as the near-field region.

At distances $r > \lambda / 2\pi$ $(kr > 1)$, Expression~1 exceeds Expression~2 in magnitude, resulting in a larger real than imaginary part  of the energy. This region is referred to as the intermediate-field region. 

At larger distances $r \gg \lambda / 2\pi$ ($kr \gg 1$) the energy is predominantly real, reflecting radiated energy propagating outward. This region is referred to as the far-field region.

	\caption{Field regions of an antenna, here specifically a linear wire antenna, although they are applicable for any antenna with dimension $d$.}
	\label{fig:fieldregionsantenna}
\end{figure}

At $r = \lambda/2\pi$ $(kr = 1)$, Expression 1 and Expression 2 are of equal magnitude. This is marked as the radian distance \cite[pp. 156-160]{Balanis_1997}. The radian distance therefore represents an important transition point between field regions, where the behavior of the fields shifts. \autoref{fig:kroverdistance} visualizes Expression~1 and Expression~2 over $r$. The analysis of the field regions presented here can be conducted analogously for both the small and infinitesimal magnetic dipole.

Antennas, which cannot be modeled as infinitesimal dipoles, such as the linear wire antenna, are surrounded by different field regions. They are shown in \autoref{fig:fieldregionsantenna}. The far-field region contains mostly real energy, and the antenna may be most accurately approximated by an infinitesimal electric dipole. In the radiating near-field, the energy is largely real, but depends on the distance $r$. Lastly, in the reactive near-field the energy is mostly imaginary.

The far-field region starts at approximately $r_2$ and the radiating near-field at $r_1$, which are defined as

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
		r_1=0.62\sqrt{d^3/\lambda},
		\label{eqn:region_r1}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	r_2=2d^2/\lambda.
	\label{eqn:region_r2}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Here, $d$ is the largest dimension of the antenna. In the case of the linear wire antenna, $d$ is the wire length \cite[pp. 165-170]{Balanis_1997}.

\subsubsection{Energy densities and reactances}\label{sec:energy-densities-reactances}
The energy density is given by \cite[p. 330]{Griffiths_2024}

\begin{equation}
	w_\mathrm{em} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\underbrace{\vphantom{\frac{1}{\mu} B ^ 2}{\epsilon E^2}}_{{\text{Electric energy}\ w_e}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{\mu} B ^ 2}_{{\text{Magnetic energy} \ w_m}}\right).
	\label{eqn:em_energy}
\end{equation}

Integrating $w_\mathrm{em}$ over a volume yields the total electromagnetic energy within that volume. Similarly, integrating $w_e$ gives the electric energy $W_e$, and $w_m$ the magnetic energy $W_m$.

The reactance of an electrically short antenna directly relates to the electric and magnetic energies $w_e$, $w_m$, that it produces. The antennas's equivalent inductance and capacitance can be derived through \cite[pp. 107, 328]{Griffiths_2024}

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
		L = 2\frac{W_m}{I^2},
		\label{eqn:l_m_energy}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		C = 2 \frac{W_e}{V^2}.
		\label{eqn:c_e_energy}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

%The electrically short antennas located in the TEM cell interact with it mostly through the reactive near-field region. However, if the TEM cell is large and frequencies are high, the coupling occurs over the radiating near-field. There, the field distributions are different, hence the dipole moments couple differently over frequency to the cell. \todo[inline]{Is this even possible without reaching other modes behavior? And demonstrate the fields over frequency and distance, which changes differently in different regions}.

%An infinitesimal dipole is taken as an antenna. The fields are calculated through the auxiliary fields, as described earlier by \autoref{eqn:elec_and_mag_field_dipole}, which leads to \autoref{eqn:inf_dipole_h_field} for the magnetic field strength and \autoref{eqn:inf_dipole_e_field} for the electric field strength. Those equations are valid everywhere, except for the source point \cite{Balanis_1997}.

%\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:inf_dipole_h_field}
%	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hr_htheta}
%		H_r = H_\theta = 0
%	\end{equation}
%	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hphi}
%		H_\phi = j \frac{k I_0 l \sin \theta}{4 \pi r}
%		\left[ 1 + \frac{1}{j k r} \right] e^{-j k r}
%	\end{equation}
%\end{subequations}
%
%
%\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:inf_dipole_e_field}
%	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:er}
%		E_r = \eta \frac{I_0 l \cos \theta}{2 \pi r^2} 
%		\left[ 1 + \frac{1}{jkr} \right] e^{-jkr}
%	\end{equation}
%	
%	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:etheta}
%		E_\theta = j \eta \frac{k I_0 l \sin \theta}{4 \pi r} 
%		\left[ 1 + \frac{1}{jkr} - \frac{1}{(kr)^2} \right] e^{-jkr}
%	\end{equation}
%
%	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ephi}
%		E_\phi = 0
%	\end{equation}
%\end{subequations}

%The distance of $\lambda / 2\pi$, leading to $kr = 1$, is called radian distance, where $r$ is the distance to the antenna and $k$ is the free-space wave number. There, the real and imaginary part for both $H_\phi$ and $E_r$ is equal. Furthermore in $E_\theta$, only the $1/(jkr)$ term contributes to the field, because the other terms cancel each other out. The radian distance essentially marks a point of equal imaginary and stored power \cite{Balanis_1997}.
%
%In distances smaller than the radian distance $kr<1$, the fields are largely reactive and located in a reactive near-field region. There, the field strength decreases with the cube of the distance ($\propto 1/r^3$).  
%At distances beyond the radian distance (kr > 1), in the intermediate-field region, the field strength decreases with the square of the distance ($\propto 1/r^2$) \cite{Balanis_1997}. This behavior is visualized in \autoref{fig:energyfieldsregions}.
%
%The wave-number $k$ is dependent on the frequency. Therefore, when placing an infinitesimal dipole into a TEM cell, its coupling behavior depends on the distance and the field regions, that couple. For that reason, the $kr$ number shall be investigated over the whole frequency range for different distances.
